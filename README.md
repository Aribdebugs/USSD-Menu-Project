Begainner friendly Transaction Menu project in Python

This Python project simulates the bKash transaction menu, a widely-used mobile banking service in Bangladesh. The script provides an interactive command-line interface allowing users to perform various bKash transactions such as sending money, cashing out, mobile recharge, and making payments. It also includes functionalities for checking balance, viewing statements, changing PIN, and accessing help.

Features:

- User-Friendly Interface: Emulates the actual bKash USSD menu, offering a straightforward and intuitive user experience.
- Transaction Types: Supports sending money, cashing out, mobile recharge, and payments.
- My bKash Options: Allows users to check balance, view statements, and change PIN.
- Help Menu: Provides options to call the bKash helpline or return to the main menu.
- Error Handling: Ensures valid inputs and selections, prompting users to correct invalid entries.

How It Works:

1. Initial Setup: The user is prompted to dial the bKash USSD code (*247#). Upon entering the correct code, the main menu is displayed.
2. Menu Options: Users can choose from:
   - (1) Send money
   - (2) Cash out
   - (3) Mobile Recharge
   - (4) Payment
   - (5) My bKash
   - (6) Help
   - (7) Exit
3. Transaction Process: 
   - Send Money/Cash Out: The user enters the recipient or agent number, amount, and PIN. The balance is updated, and the transaction is confirmed.
   - Mobile Recharge: The user selects their mobile operator, enters the mobile number, amount, and PIN. The recharge is confirmed, and the balance is updated.
   - Payment: The user enters the merchant number, amount, and PIN. The payment is processed and confirmed.
4. Additional Options: Users can check their balance, view statements, change their PIN, or call the bKash helpline.
5. Exiting: Users can exit the program by selecting option (7).

 Benefits:

- Comprehensive Simulation: Provides a complete simulation of the bKash service, making it an excellent learning tool.
- Efficient and Maintainable: Well-structured code that avoids redundancy, ensuring smooth user interactions.

Explore the code, provide feedback, and contribute to further improvements. This project is an excellent resource for learning about basic programming concepts and user interaction design in Python.
